# Data Structures & Algorithms in Java

Welcome to my DSA practice repository! 👨‍💻

This repo is a collection of my **hand-written implementations** of important Data Structures and Algorithms in **Java**, built from scratch — without relying on built-in libraries — to deepen my understanding of how things work under the hood.

## ✅ What's Covered

### 📦 Data Structures
- Arrays
- Linked Lists (Singly, Doubly, Circular)
- Stacks
- Queues
- Trees (Binary, BST, AVL, etc.)
- Heaps
- Hash Tables / Hash Maps
- Graphs
- Tries
- Disjoint Sets (Union-Find)

### ⚙️ Algorithms
- Sorting Algorithms (Bubble, Selection, Merge, Quick, etc.)
- Searching Algorithms (Linear, Binary)
- Recursion & Backtracking
- Dynamic Programming
- Greedy Algorithms
- Graph Algorithms (BFS, DFS, Dijkstra’s, Kruskal’s, Prim’s)
- Bit Manipulation
- Sliding Window, Two Pointer, etc.
- Topological Sorting
- KMP / Rabin-Karp (String Matching)
- Many more...
